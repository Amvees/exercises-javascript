name: Syntax errors
theory: |
  If a JavaScript program is syntactically incorrect, the interpreter will show a relevant message and a note with a file and line where an error might have occurred. **Syntax errors** occur when the code has grammar mistakes. Grammar is essential to human language, but lack of it won't affect your ability to read or understand any text. But in programming, everything should be strict. Even a tiny violation and your program won't run. A wrong parenthesis order, a `;` that you forgot to add â€” these are just some examples of such violations.

  Here is an example of code with a syntax error:

  ```javascript
  console.log('Hodor'
  ```

  If we run this code we will see the following message: `SyntaxError: missing ) after the argument list`. In JavaScript, such errors are called "SyntaxError". For technical reasons, such code running on [code-basics] (https://code-basics.com) won't show a note with a line and file. You can check this output on [repl.it] (https://repl.it).

  On the one hand, syntax errors are the most obvious because they deal with the rules of code grammar and have nothing to do with the code logic. You can easily fix it once you find it.

  On the other hand, interpreter will not always tell you the correct position of an error. Sometimes you need to add a forgotten bracket to another place as opposed to what the error message says.
