name: Commutative operations
theory: |
  Do you remember the basic arithmetic rule "changing the order of the numbers we are adding doesn't change the sum"? It is called the **commutative law**.

  A binary operation is commutative since swapping operands gets you the same result. Obviously, addition is a commutative operation: _3 + 2 = 2 + 3_.

  But is subtraction a commutative operation? Of course not: _2 - 3 â‰  3 - 2_. In programming, this law works just like in arithmetic.

  Moreover, most of the operations we face in real life are not commutative. Here is the conclusion: always pay attention to the order of things you work with.

      is a property of an operation when changing the order of the operands does not change the result. For example, addition is a commutative operation: changing the order of the numbers we are adding does not change the sum.
