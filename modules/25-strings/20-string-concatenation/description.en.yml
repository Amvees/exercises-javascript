name: Concatenation
theory: |

  In web development, programs use strings constantly. Everything we see on websites, in any case, is represented as text. This text is most often dynamic, it's made up of different connected pieces. The operation of joining one string to another in programming is called **concatenation**.

  ```javascript
  // The operator is the same as for adding
  // but it has different semantics (meaning)

  console.log('Dragon' + 'stone');
  // => 'Dragonstone'
  ```

  Strings always concatenate in the same order in which the operands are written. The left operand becomes the left part of the string, and the right one becomes the right part.

  Here are a few more examples:

  ```javascript
  console.log('Kings' + 'wood');     // => Kingswood

  // Reverse word order
  console.log('road' + 'Kings');     // => roadKings

  // Any string can be concatenated
  console.log("King's" + 'Landing'); // => King'sLanding
  ```

  As you can see, strings can concatenate even if they are written in different quotes.

  In the last example, the name of the city is miswritten: *King's Landing* should be written with a space. But there were no spaces at the beginning of our strings, while the spaces left and right of the `+` does not matter because they are not part of the strings.

  There are two ways out:

  ```javascript
  // Both ways are equivalent.

  // Put space in the end of the left part
  console.log("King's " + 'Landing'); //  => King's Landing
  // Put space in the beginning of the right part 
  console.log("King's" + ' Landing'); //  => King's Landing
  ```

  Space is also a symbol. The more spaces you put, the wider the indentation is:

  ```javascript
  console.log("King's " + ' Landing');   // => King's  Landing

  console.log("King's  " + '  Landing'); // => King's    Landing
  ```

instructions: |

  Print the following code

  ```
  Winter came for the House of Frey.
  ```

  using concatenation.

tips:
  - |
    Type your code between `// BEGIN` and `// END` lines in the editor.
